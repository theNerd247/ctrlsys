\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}

The DC motor system used in this lab has the following block diagram: 

\input{labBlockDiagram.tex}

Where $\theta_d$ is the desired position angle of the motor shaft and $\theta$
is the actual angle. The PID controller for this lab is reified by a computer
and the control data - namely the sensor feedback and the desired angle - are
interfaced with the system via a USB data aquisition board (noted as UDAB).
MATLAB Simulink software is used to perform measurements of the system as well
as simulate and tune the PID controller. 

As in Lab 2, the three PID constants - $K_i$,$K_p$,$K_d$ - are each isolated and
then varied to asses how each constant affects the system. In this lab, however,
the exact plant model is uknown.
