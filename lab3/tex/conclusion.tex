\section{Conclusion}

The following table can be seen as the relationship between the PID constants
and their response characteristics:

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXXXXXX}
		\toprule
		\\ & $T_r$ & $T_p$ & $T_s$ & $\%OS$ & $e_{ss}$ & $Stability$ 
		\\ \midrule
		\\ $K_p$ & inversely & inversely & small affect & increases  & inversely  & destabilizes
		\\ $K_i$ & inversely & decreases & increases & increases & eliminates & destabilizes.
		\\ $K_d$ & inversely & decreases & inversely & inversely & no effect & no effect
		\\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{Correlations Between PID Constants and Step Response Characteristics}
	\label{tab:visualResults}
\end{table}

Note, however, that these results were derived from visual inspection which does
not imply sufficient accuracy. Also, because the system model is unknown error
calculations cannot be performed. Also, as seen from part two of
\secref{results} their are small variances errors that are introduced into the
system
