\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

As seen demonstrating the properties of a basic PID controller can be done using
an isolation technique and visual inspection. From the results seen in
\secref{results}, the PID controller can be used to decrease the settling,
peak, and rise times using $K_d$ and $K_p$ and remove the steady state error
using $K_i$. To gain a better understanding of the effects of the system more
data points would be required along with statistical analysis of each curve
produced. This kind of analysis is beyond the scope of this lab.
