This experiment was designed to analyze the relationships of $K_p$, $K_i$,
$K_d$, and the system's step-response characteristics (respectively). To perform
this analysis we first design a unity-feedback control system with a PID layer
that uses a plant function that is generic enough that will give clear response
characteristics. In this experiment, $G(s) = \frac{20}{s^2+4s+3} \label{eq:gs}$ (see
\figref{ctrlSys} for the total control system model). Then we run the
simulations using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \label{isolateStep}
    Isolate a single PID constant; assigning the chosen constant with an initial
    value.

  \item \label{runStep} 
    Run the experiment using a step input and measure the output characteristics.

  \item Rerun from \ref{runStep}, varying the isolated parameter by a small
    amount.

  \item Rerun from \ref{isolateStep} choosing a different constant to isolate.
    Note that for the $K_i$ and $K_d$ constants $K_p$ is not ``eliminated'' but
    held constant at $1$. This is to make the step response stable (in most
    cases) and approaching $1$.
\end{enumerate}

This experiment was performed using a Matlab$^\copyright$ script. See
\apref{source_code} for the actual script.
